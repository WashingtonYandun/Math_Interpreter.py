# Math Interpreter

This is simple a math interpreter, made in python.

## Tech Stack

-   [python](https://www.python.org/)

## Features (AM WORKING ON THEM)

-   Supports basic math operations
-   Supports basic trigonometry operations
-   Supports basic logarithmic operations
-   Supports basic exponential operations
-   Supports basic absolute value operations
-   Supports basic factorial operations
-   Supports basic modulo operations

## Why this project?

-   I wanted to make a simple math interpreter that helps me to understand how lexical analysis works. Also this is going to be a good example of how to use the lexer and parser. It will help me when i will need to write a compiler for my (future) language "W" (idk how to call it rn). I hope you enjoy it! :)
